> FAQ:
> **Q: Doesn't this violate discord tos?**
> **A: No because the discord api used in this project is simply to query user information, other third parties use it on a regular basis for backend or frontend code, simply meaning said "public" can be used for simple tasks like this.**

> **Q: Can i use the code from this for my own project or can i rebrand and distribute this?**
> **A: Yes. Because the whole reason i put it on github is for said project to be open source, do what you like with it, however, if i have left some private information in the code, notify me immediately.**

> **Q: Why make such a useless project?**
> **A: Boredom is the main contributor for me making this project, the design looks decent and it fits perfectly with the goal of the project.**
